# Android Automated UI Testing - Demonstration

In this document, the implementation process of the test case *addItemAndDelete* will be detailed, including the reasons for choosing a testing framework to perform the step or not.

## Environment

Emulator Device: Pixel 6Emulator 

Android Version: API 26, Android 8.0

Application: *Personal Stuff* 

Solution: https://github.com/guruizhen/a-personal-stuff-solution 

## Test Steps

### 1. Click *"Add Item"* on the home page.

If you are going to use UIAutomator for this test case, you could start by creating an *UiDevice* object.

```java
UiDevice device = UiDevice.getInstance(getInstrumentation());
```

You can locate the *"Add Item"* button and perform the click action on it by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

**Please note:** it is possible that it takes some time when you launch an application. To avoid flakiness, you could add a waiting step by UIAutomator before all of your actions.

```java
device.wait(Until.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/button_add_item")), 5000);
```

#### Espresso

The Android ID of this view can be found in the resource file *res/layout/page_home.xml*.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.button_add_item)).perform(click());
```

#### UIAutomator

The resource ID of the element can be found by uiautomatorviewer.

```java
device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/button_add_item")).click();
// You can also write it like this
UiObject2 add_item = device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/button_add_item"));
add_item.click();
```

### 2. Enter "Cookie" in the *"Name"* field.

You can locate the *"Name"* field and enter text in it by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

#### Espresso

The Android ID of this view can be found in the resource file *res/layout/page_item_detail.xml*.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.input_text_name)).perform(typeText("Cookie"));
```

#### UIAutomator

**Please note:** it is recommended to add a waiting step between two actions from two different activities.

```java
device.wait(Until.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/input_text_name")), 5000);
device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/input_text_name")).setText("Cookie");
```

### 3. Click *"+1"* next to the *"Amount"* field.

You can locate the *"+1"* button and click it by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

#### Espresso

The Android ID of this view can be found in the resource file *res/layout/page_item_detail.xml*.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.button_plus_1)).perform(click());
```

#### UIAutomator

```java
device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/input_text_name")).setText("Cookie");
```

### 4. Enter "10" in the *"Price"* field.

You can locate the "Price" field and enter text in it by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

#### Espresso

The Android ID of this view can be found in the resource file *res/layout/page_item_detail.xml*.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.input_text_price)).perform(typeText("10"));
```

#### UIAutomator

```java
device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/input_text_price")).setText("10");
```

### 5. Click *"Expired date time"* and select 31 January 2023 then click *"OK"*.

#### 5.1 Click *"Expired date time"* 

The *"Expired date time"* field can be located and clicked by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

##### Espresso

The Android ID of this view can be found in the resource file *res/layout/page_item_detail.xml*.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.input_text_expired_date_time)).perform(click());
```

##### UIAutomator

```java
device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/input_text_expired_date_time")).click();
```

#### 5.2 Click *"next"* icon to navigate to January 2023

It can be found in *app/src/main/java/m/co/rh/id/a_personal_stuff/app/ui/page/ItemDetailPage.java* that the date picker dialog is a custom view. The custom view class is from a external library *com.github.rh-id.a-navigator:a-navigator-extension-dialog*, and the dependency can be found in *base/build.gradle*.

It is recommended to use UIAutomator to find a custom view, the resource ID of the *"next"* icon *"android:id/next"* can be found by uiautomatorviewer.

##### UIAutomator

**Please note:** it is recommended to add a waiting step when a new dialog is popped up.

```java
device.wait(Until.findObject(By.res("android:id/next")), 5000);
device.findObject(By.res("android:id/next")).click();
```

#### 5.3 Click *"31"* in the calendar

The calendar is also a part of the custom view, like the *"next"* icon, so UIAutomator is preferred.

The *"31"* element can be located by text.

##### UIAutomator

```java
device.findObject(By.text("31")).click();
```

#### 5.4 Click *"OK"* button

The *"OK"* button can be located and clicked by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

##### Espresso

The Android ID of this view can be found in the resource file *res/layout/page_item_select.xml*.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.button_ok)).perform(click());
```

##### UIAutomator

```java
device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/button_ok")).click();
```

### 6. Click the *"save"* icon in the bottom right corner.

The *"save"* icon can be located and clicked by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

#### Espresso

The Android ID of this view can be found in the resource file *res/menu/page_item_detail.xml*.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.menu_save)).perform(click());
```

#### UIAutomator

**Please note**: it is recommended to add a waiting step when a dialog is disabled.

```java
device.wait(Until.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/menu_save")), 5000);
device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/menu_save")).click();
```

### 7. Swipe from left to right on the home page to open the menu.

Espresso has the default swipe APIs *swipeLeft()*, *swipeRight()*, *swipeDown()* and *swipeUp()*.

You can specify the start and end points' coordinates and the speed of a swipe action by UIAutomator's *device.swipe()* API. 

The descriptions of Espresso swipe APIs show *"The swipe doesn't start at the very edge of the view, but has a bit of offset."*. In order to open the menu on the home page, the swipe needs to start at the edge of the view. UIAutomator is recommended for this swipe action.

The size of the device is 1080x2400.

#### UIAutomator

```java
device.swipe(10, 1200, 1000, 1200, 5);
```

### 8. Click *"Items"* on the menu.

The *"Items"* option cab be located and clicked by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

#### Espresso

The Android ID of this view can be found in the resource file *res/layout/page_home.xml*.

```java
onView(withId(R.id.menu_items)).perform(click());
```

#### UIAutomator

```java
device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/menu_items")).click();
```

### 9. Assert the name of the item as "Cookie".

The name field and its attributes can be accessed and checked by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

#### Espresso

```java
onView(withId(R.id.text_name)).check(matches(withText("Cookie")));
```

#### UIAutomator

```java
assertEquals("Cookie", device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/text_name")).getText());
```

### 10.  Assert the Amount of the item as "1".

The amount field and its attributes can be accessed and checked by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

#### Espresso

```java
onView(withId(R.id.text_amount)).check(matches(withText("Amount: 1")));
```

#### UIAutomator

```java
assertEquals("Amount: 1", device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/text_amount")).getText());
```

### 11. Assert the Price of the item as "10".

The price field and its attributes can be accessed and checked by both Espresso and UIAutomator.

#### Espresso

```java
onView(withId(R.id.text_price)).check(matches(withText("Price: 10")));
```

#### UIAutomator

```java
assertEquals("Price: 10", device.findObject(By.res("m.co.rh.id.a_personal_stuff:id/text_price")).getText());
```

### 12. Click the *"delete"* button at the bottom of the item's view then click *"OK"*.
